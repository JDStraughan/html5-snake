# html5-snake

Okay, so I'm up to 2 games in my repertoire. 

The last game, [lightcycles](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-lightcycles), was a great learning experience, and I tried to apply some of the lessons learned there to this game.

## Installation

It's just HTML, CSS, and javascript.  Open it in a modern browser and have fun.

Too lazy to download?  [Play it on jsfiddle (may be older version of game)](http://jsfiddle.net/zT7V4/1/).

## Inspiration

[lightcycles](https://github.com/JDStraughan/html5-lightcycles) was a blast to write, and it really made me think about how to make my snake move (hehe).  I decided on making and array, and just shift()ing and push()ing segments.  This is what I ended up with.
